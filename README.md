# May-Long-Challenge(Problem statements)
For SOLBLTY:
**Suppose for a unit rise in temperature, the solubility of sugar in water increases by Bg100 mL.
Chef does an experiment to check how much sugar (in g) he can dissolve given that he initially has 1 liter of water at X degrees and the solubility of sugar at this temperature is Ag100 mL. Also, Chef doesn't want to lose any water so he can increase the temperature to at most 100 degrees.
Assuming no loss of water takes place during the process, find the maximum amount of sugar (in g) can be dissolved in 1 liter of water under the given conditions.**


For LKDNGOLF:
**It's a lockdown. You’re bored in your house and are playing golf in the hallway.
The hallway has N+2 tiles numbered from 0 to N+1 from left to right. There is a hole on tile number x. You hit the ball standing on tile 0. When you hit the ball, it bounces at lengths of k, i.e. the tiles covered by it are 0,k,2k,…, and so on until the ball passes tile N+1.
If the ball doesn't enter the hole in the first trial, you try again but this time standing on the tile N+1. When you hit the ball, it bounces at lengths of k, i.e. the tiles covered by it are (N+1),(N+1−k),(N+1−2k),…, and so on until the ball passes tile 0.
Find if the ball will enter the hole, either in its forward journey or backward journey.**

For XOREQUAL:
**For a given N, find the number of ways to choose an integer x from the range [0,2^N−1] such that x⊕(x+1)=(x+2)⊕(x+3), where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operator.
Since the number of valid x can be large, output it modulo 10^9+7.**

For TCTCTOE:
**Tic-tac-toe is a game played between two players on a 3×3 grid. In a turn, a player chooses an empty cell and places their symbol on the cell. The players take alternating turns, where the player with the first turn uses the symbol X and the other player uses the symbol O. The game continues until there is a row, column, or diagonal containing three of the same symbol (X or O), and the player with that token is declared the winner. Otherwise if every cell of the grid contains a symbol and nobody won, then the game ends and it is considered a draw.
You are given a tic-tac-toe board A after a certain number of moves, consisting of symbols O, X, and underscore(_). Underscore signifies an empty cell.**
